# PFC — Prime Flow Calculus Protocol

**Deterministic Governance Runtime & Evidence Architecture for AI Systems**

PFC is a specification for a deterministic governance runtime and evidence-generation layer for AI systems.

It defines a reference architecture for:

- Enforcing externally defined constraints at execution time
- Producing machine-verifiable, deterministic evidence artifacts
- Supporting audit, oversight, and compliance evaluation
- Operating without access to model internals, training data, or provider infrastructure

This repository contains the public specification, reference architecture, threat model, and conformance model.

---

## What This Is

PFC is:

- A governance and assurance architecture
- A system-boundary control and evidence layer
- A deterministic, audit-oriented execution envelope
- An implementation-agnostic reference specification

It is intended for:

- AI safety and evaluation
- Governance and oversight frameworks
- Compliance and auditability
- Standards and policy discussion

---

## What This Is Not

PFC is not:

- A product
- A model
- A training system
- A content moderation layer
- A provider-specific tool
- A post-hoc analysis framework

It does not require access to:

- Model internals
- Training data
- Provider infrastructure

---

## Core Idea

Modern AI governance relies heavily on policy, process, and post-hoc analysis. PFC proposes a different approach:

> A deterministic governance runtime that enforces constraints at execution time and emits machine-verifiable evidence artifacts.

This enables:

- Real auditability
- Verifiable compliance
- Reproducible oversight
- Provider-independent assurance
